notes for final

3 hours
mostly programming similar to projects
no report

make sure to use comments/pseudo code and/or notes numeric method intended (partial credit if code not working)

no open ended questions - give matlab "framework" for how to output code / figures (e.g., produce array x to pass to figure function provided)

designing questions so that she can do it in ~1 hour (how long it takes her x3 = final duration)

likely to ask questions with answer not in book
(not going to ask something that can 100% use pseudo code in book)
but questions will utilize code we have written and what we learned



topics

projects dealt with material up to ~rungekutta

final deal with mostly after that

gaussian elim
solving non linear systems
finite difference methods



ch 6
did not do cholesky
did not do kraut factorization of tridiagonal (pg 427)


did not do  ch7
did not do  ch8
did not do  ch9


ch10
did newtons
did broyden (quasi newton)
did steepest descent (need to do this)

ch 11
did linear/nonlinear shooting methods (did not finish code - probably not on final)
did linear finite difference (need to finish code - more likely to be on final)




will be given derivatives if they are needed
